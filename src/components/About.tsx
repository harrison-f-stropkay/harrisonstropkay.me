      Hi, I'm John Doe! I'm a software engineer with a passion for building web applications. I enjoy using technologies
      like React, TypeScript, and Node.js to create scalable and user-friendly software. When I'm not coding, you can
      find me exploring the great outdoors or reading a good book.
